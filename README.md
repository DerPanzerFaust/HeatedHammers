## Final Concept
### Our game is a local cooperative game, there are a maximum of 4 players, each with their own gamepad to control their character. When the game starts, a robot comes out of the floor in the middle of the room, which is broken in several limbs and parts. The goal of the 4 players is to repair that robot by, for example, creating new parts at workstations or refilling and cleaning various parts on the robot. They do this under time pressure. Because a timer runs out that keeps track of how long the players have left to play. If this timer hits 0 it is game over. Once they have completely repaired a robot, they get extra time on this general timer so they can continue playing longer. The robot itself also has a timer that counts down. If this timer hits 0 and the robot is still not fully repaired by the players. Then the robot will break and time will be deducted from the overall timer. When a robot is finished or broken, the old robot will disappear into the floor and a new robot will emerge from the floor in its place. This new robot has its own new timer that will count down again.
